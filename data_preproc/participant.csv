Actually,I  might have left a little cash to build up some cash reserves in the first 5 rounds.

I had concerns that the peak would happen around Round 15, but I jumped the gun a bit. I could have held out longer for about 12% higher sale prices, but I wanted to unload my entire holdings before the peak. I was concerned that if the market fell flat, then finding a buyer would become increasingly difficult and I might have to sacrifice more than I might stand to gain by holding out for those final few points. I think I was all cash by Round 20 and I collected only from the 5% interest each round. ","It seemed redundant to offer the text instructions so far away from the video instructions. It would have been nice to have those on the same page so that after completing the video, the text was available for quick reference. 

The Google docs pre-survey within the experiment tab seemed unusual. This was a minor inconvenience because it required more scrolling rather than having an entire tab's worth of view. 

If I could suggest an improvement to the dashboard, I felt that the experiment could be more exciting if there were a scoreboard so that players could know their standing in terms of total net worth. It was nice to play with other users, but the interactions felt quite empty. This is just wishful thinking because I find that competition brings out the best in my performance.
