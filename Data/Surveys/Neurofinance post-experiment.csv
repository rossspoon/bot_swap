So initially, I decided I would not buy over 14 and would only sell above 14. I ended up selling my stocks pretty quickly as the prices went up. It was clear that the price was roughly going to go up before going down before of the fixed by-back price (or maybe just stay up if nobody managed to sell before the end, as the buy-back was 14). As I didn't know if on the way up the price was going to be monotonic or oscillate a bit, at some point I placed some buy orders for maximum 1 stock around 30 (when the price was already close to 40 I think, around turn 10 or so maybe), hoping that I could maybe make some more money if I could sell back later. But this didn't happen, the price kept going up around 50, and so I decided I would just ""sleep"" on my cash until the end. As the price started going down very rapidly in the last round, I placed some buy orders around 13 (hoping some people may panic and didn't understand the buy-back was at 14), but that did not happen and the price stabilized around 16-17.","Regarding the instruction, I think they were rather clear, except for the reward for the forecasting which I missed or maybe read too rapidly. Maybe you could do a live presentation (or record a short video) to present orally the rules before.
The interface takes a little bit to get used to to place the buy and sell orders, but it was fine for me after a while. The time was a little short in general.
The forecast 4 rounds ahead was a little tedious at some point, maybe because of the interface wit which it was hard to pick exactly a price.
The risk elicitation task was my least favorite, as it felt very repetitive (and not fun like the trading for instance, where interactive stuff is happening). Also the time for it was a little short, and I think there might have been a bug in mine as I would sometimes have to chose between ""do you prefer 100% chances 9$ or do you prefer 20$ with 100% chances"", where of course I'd pick the latter ","","35","2","","","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","2","2","2","2","14L"

That's how I understand it works best in the real stock market.","It would be nice if the math terms could match up, i.e. express the cash interest/dividend as a decimal, the same as the stock dividend, or vice versa.
